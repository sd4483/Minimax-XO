# Minimax-XO

An - almost - unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game based on Minimax AI Algorithm.

#Info 

Minimax is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. 
Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. 
  
This rule was evolved into an AI Algorithm used in many board games (chess, connect four, tic tac toe..etc) while it's so hard to implement for chess, it's trivial to implement for tic tac toe. 


#Game Features :

- Scores board.
- Written in Python.
- Player is always X.
- Interactive game (even it's a console one).
- alpha-burring algorithm is used (optimized minimax).
